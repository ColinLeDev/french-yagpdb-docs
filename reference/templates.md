# Templates

{% hint style="warning" %}
Put curly brackets around the templates like this: `{{.User.Username}}`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to put a template inside a template \(e.g. to wrap toString in joinStr around .Guild.MemberCount\), you use normal braces:  
`{{joinStr "" "Our member count is " (toString .Guild.MemberCount) "!"}}`
{% endhint %}

### Snippets

* `<@{{.User.ID}}>` Outputs a mention to the user that called the command.
* `<@###########>` Mentions the user that has the ID \#\#\#\#\#\# \(See [How to get IDs](templates.md#how-to-get-ids) to get ID\).
* `<#&&&&&&&&&&&>` Mentions the channel that has ID &&&&&& \(See [How to get IDs](templates.md#how-to-get-ids) to get ID\).
* `{{if hasRoleName "funrole"}} Has role funrole {{end}}`This will only show if the member has a role with name "funrole" .
* `{{if gt (len .Args) 0}} {{index .Args 1}} {{end}}` Assuming your trigger is a command, will display your first input if input was given.

* `{{if ne .User.ID #######}}` Will ignore if user ID \#\#\#\#\# uses command.
* `{{$d := randInt 10}}` Store the random int into variable $d \(A random number from 0-9\).
* `{{addReactions .CmdArgs}}` Adds the emoji following a trigger as reactions.
* `{{$a := (exec "catfact")}}` Saves the response of the `catfact` ****command to variable `$a`. 
* `{{$allArgs := (joinStr " " .CmdArgs)}}` Saves all the argument to a variable `$allArgs`. 
* `{{$args:= (joinStr " " (slice .CmdArgs 1))}}` Saves all the arguments except the first one to a variable `$args`.

* `{{ $x := sendMessageRetID nil "Hello there!" }} {{ addMessageReactions nil $x "üëç" "üëé" }} {{ deleteMessage nil $x 5 }}` Sends message to current channel `nil` and gets messageID to variable `$x`. Also adds reactions to this message. After 5 seconds, deletes that message.
* To demonstrate usage of escapeEveryoneHere &gt; `{{ $x := "@here Hello World! @everyone" }} {{ sendMessage nil $x }} {{ sendMessageNoEscape nil $x }} {{ sendMessageNoEscape nil ( escapeEveryoneHere $x ) }}`
* To demonstrate usage of targetHasRoleID &gt;  `{{ $x := ( userArg ( index .Args 1) ).ID }} {{ if targetHasRoleID $x ############ }} Has the Role! {{ else }} Does not have the role! {{ end }}`

## How to get IDs <a id="how-to-get-ids"></a>

**User IDs:** Can be found by mentioning the user then adding a \ such as `\@jonas747#0001` . Alternatively if you have developer mode on, you can right click and select Copy ID

**Channel IDs:** Can be found by mentioning the channel then adding a \ such as `\#announcements`. Alternatively if you have developer mode on, you can right click on the channel and select Copy ID.

**Role IDs**: Use the `listroles`command.

**Emote IDs:** 

If it is a **custom emote**, adding a \ in front of the emote such as `\:yag:` will display the name along with the ID such as  `<:yag:277569741932068864>`.

If it is an **animated emote**, do the same steps as a normal emote. If you do not have Discord Nitro, you can have a friend or a bot use the emote and right click on the emote to open its link. The ID will be a part of the URL.

If it is a **default emote**, look up the Unicode for the emote on Google. Note that some of the more customized default emotes such as some of the family emotes will not work in any of the YAGPDB commands.
