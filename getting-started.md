## Setup

The setup for YAGPDB is pretty simple.

1. Go to [yagpdb.xyz/manage](https://yagpdb.xyz/manage)
2. Click on **Login**
3. Authorize YAGPDB.xyz to know what servers you are on. 
4. On the upper-right-corner, you can select your server by clicking on **Select a server** and selecting the server you want to add the bot to and manage.

You should start out by visiting the commands tab, making sure the prefix does not have any conflict as well as turn on and off any command\(s\) you may not want to be used. 

If you're interested in setting notifications like _Join/Leave, YouTube, Reddit, Streaming notifications._ You should look under the **Notifications & Feeds** tab. 

For _moderation tools, auto-moderation tools, auto roles, self assigning roles_ visit the **Tools & Utilities** tab. 

* **Moderation** can help you keep track of offences with warnings, and a moderation log. 
* **Auto-moderation** can help you keep track of bad words, bad websites, spam, mention spam, invite posting, bad nickname/names etc. 
* **Auto role** can help with assigning roles when members join. 
* **Role commands** can help with members assigning roles to themselves through either commands or reactions. 

For a _soundboard or reputation_, check out the **Fun** tab. 

Click through the various pages and explore a little to see what the bot offers. If you need help read around in the control panel, the docs, or our [FAQ ](others/frequent-searches.md)page. If you still need help, you can visit our support server. 

We have a limited number of volunteer support staff, and we are losing money hosting this bot for you. \*_If you're being rude in the support server, chances are you're gonna get banned.\*_
