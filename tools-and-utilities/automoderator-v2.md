#### Tips

Generally speaking most people want to have "ignore bots" as a ruleset condition, that way bots won't trigger any rules.

A simple way to have it is to keep all the basic stuff \(invites, spam mentions, safebrowsing etc\) in a single rule, then have a single violation counter and a rule for each tier of punishment \(warn, kick, mute, ban\)

## Introduction

![](../.gitbook/assets/automod2.0_2.PNG)

Automod V2 is a completely new auto-moderator system made from the ground up. When starting out you will need to create a new ruleset.

If you'd rather watch a video, we made a short basic intro on [YouTube](%20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dfjYJShzywâ€‹).

#### Rulesets

Rulesets are how you will group your auto moderation rules, you will need one to start out. A ruleset can be toggled on or off in the control panel with the `-automod toggle <ruleset name>` command.

#### List

List is where you will enter a list of words or websites for the auto-moderation system to use such as a list of banned websites/banned words/banned names etc.

#### Logs

Every time a rule is triggered, a log will be posted with the Date, User, Rule, and Trigger that caused it. This is helpful to find out what exactly happened.

## Ruleset Settings

In each rule sets you have several options

* **Name:** You can edit the name of your rule
* **Enable rule set:** You can toggle the rule set on and off 
* **Ruleset scoped condition:** Assigned conditions that will apply to every rule\` in the rule set. 
* **Create a new rule:** Create a new rule in the ruleset

## Rule Setting 

![Each rule will have a combination of Trigger, Condition, and Effects. ](../.gitbook/assets/automod2.0.PNG)

**Triggers:** A variety of different parameters that can configured to trigger the rule. Multiple parameters can be set but only one needs to activate to trigger the rule.   
**Conditions**: Restrictions or parameters set to limit who can trigger the rule. Multiple conditions can be set and all must be valid in order to allow the trigger.  
**Effects**: The effect that the rule will cause. Multiple effects can be added and all of them will be activated whenever the trigger is activated

## Violations 

When you create a violation, you will need to assign it a name. Each violation name will act like a key which has its own separate count. 

**Example:** If you have two violation names`links` and `badName`, `+violation` with the name `links` will increment the `links` violation counter for that user while `badName` will remains the same.

Then you can set up a rule with the  `x violations in y minutes` trigger so that when someone increments the counter `x times within y minutes`, the rule will trigger. Using this you can set up tiered punishments where repeated violations causes stricter punishments.

## Rule Options

### Trigger Types
